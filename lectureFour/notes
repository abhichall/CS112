Union Find - groupings of objects by criteria

the union find data strcuture supports two options:

union(x,y): 'unions' x and y
find(x): takes a SINGLE object x, and returns the group that x belongs to

Union Find is useful in graph type problems. 
connect all the objects that belong to the same group with an 'edge'
one element in the group is tagged as the 'representative' - this element will represent the entire group it belongs two
on a root tree diagram, the representative will be the highest parent ** at the top of the root tree
during union - set the root of one tree to be the child of another


how to implement Union Find:

Initialize an array -> Parent[i] = i

Implent find function, this will find the root of the tree that contains x find(Parent[x])

union (x,y)
Parent(find[y]) = find[x]
this will find the root of y and the root of x, and then will set the parent of one to be the parent of the other



In a stack, 
push means to add
pop method removes and returns the top elemnts of the stack

initial capacity list for an array is 10
