java will allocate the memory needed to keep track of the variable value
runtime stack - always start at top - think of plate stack
activation record - where the variable value is initially kept track of 
'new' for object - when you say new, it will be in the heap

student s1 = new student ();
student s2 = s1;
student s3 = new student ();
when you say new, it will create a new object and therfore have a different object;
basically 'new' creates a new object with its own unique address
s1=s3 --> they point to the same address

breakpoint - debugging -  to stop the program execution at some point before movng forward - just click the left of the number on the line; then click debug, will trace variables


big O
tilde notation - discard lower-order terms
big o notation - also discard leading coefficient

use tilde notation to:
count core operations
make predictions about running time - in seconds
measure memory usage

use big theta notation:
analyze performance independence of machine, compiler, JVM
